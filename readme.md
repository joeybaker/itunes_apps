What this is
===========
These are just some quick applescripts I've put together to take some of the pain out of tagging my iTunes library. I hook them up to keyboard shortcuts which allows me to move much quicker than switching to iTunes every time I want to make a change.

### Apps

* Set Grouping (of the currently playing song)
* Set Genre (of the currently playing song)
* See Current Song Info (requires growl)

### License
I dunno, whateverâ€¦ if you like it, you're welcome to it. Keep my name associated with it please. (as long as you're not using these to take over the world or anything)

### Changelog
### v.2
* made the show info script much more useful with lots more data and album artwork.
* the info script now has some failure checks (it won't crash if growl isn't running)

#### v.1
* init
* These apps work entirely through AppleScript
* Changing the track data will affect just the currently playing song at the time the app is activated. If the song ends and another starts playing, the track data that's changed will only affect the song that was playing when the app was opened.
* Growl required to see the current song info.
